# TinyGPSPlus

A new, customizable Arduino NMEA parsing library
A *NEW* Full-featured GPS/NMEA Parser for Arduino
TinyGPSPlus is a new Arduino library for parsing NMEA data streams provided by GPS modules.

1.1-beta update: Several pull requests incorporated (or equiv)

* [38](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus/pull/38) Added Fix Quality and Fix Mode
* [66/109](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus/pull/66) Fix stringop truncation warning
* [69](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus/pull/69) Support for non-Arduino platforms
* [88](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus/pull/88) Slight change to earth radius
* [106](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus/pull/106) Support all satellite groups

Like its predecessor, TinyGPS, this library provides compact and easy-to-use methods for extracting position, date, time, altitude, speed, and course from consumer GPS devices.

However, TinyGPSPlusâ€™s programmer interface is considerably simpler to use than TinyGPS, and the new library can extract arbitrary data from any of the myriad NMEA sentences out there, even proprietary ones.

See [Arduiniana - TinyGPSPlus](http://arduiniana.org/libraries/tinygpsplus/) for more detailed information on how to use TinyGPSPlus.
